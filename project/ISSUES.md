## Open

## ISSUE-011: `.env` NEO4J_URI is container DNS — migration script breaks if `.env` is sourced
**Found:** 2026-05-11, during API-based seeding task
**Severity:** P3 (nice-to-fix)
**Where:** `.env` line 1 (`NEO4J_URI=bolt://neo4j:7687`), `scripts/migrations/add_faction_support.py`
**Description:** `.env` sets `NEO4J_URI=bolt://neo4j:7687` (container hostname). If a user
sources `.env` into the shell before running the migration script from outside Docker,
the Neo4j connection fails — `neo4j` hostname is only resolvable inside the Docker network.
The migration script already defaults to `localhost:7687` via `os.getenv()`, but the trap
is invisible unless documented.
**Why deferred:** Documentation-only fix; no code change required.
**To fix:** Documented in `docs/API.md` under "Migration script" section. Optionally add a
prominent comment in `.env` warning against sourcing it for outside-Docker tooling.

## ISSUE-004: edge_updater.py — no-any-return from dump_json
**Found:** 2026-05-06, during Phase 1.2 (faction-aware gossip)
**Severity:** P3 (nice-to-fix)
**Where:** `src/npc_engine/engines/gossip/edge_updater.py:45`
**Description:** `dump_json()` returns `Any`, so `return dump_json(...)` on a function
declared `-> str` triggers `mypy [no-any-return]`. Pre-existing before Phase 1.
**Why deferred:** Not introduced by Phase 1 changes; low risk.
**To fix:** Add `cast(str, dump_json(...))` on the return line, or annotate `dump_json` as `-> str`.

## ISSUE-005: adjust_reputation_for_event not wired to event engine
**Found:** 2026-05-06, during Phase 1.3 planning
**Severity:** P3 (nice-to-fix)
**Where:** Future `src/npc_engine/graph/reputation_writer.py` (Phase 1.3)
**Description:** `adjust_reputation_for_event` will be implemented in 1.3 but the
event engine wiring that calls it (e.g., killing a faction member → -20 reputation)
is out of scope for Phase 1. The function will exist but never be triggered automatically.
**Why deferred:** Requires engine changes belonging to a later phase.
**To fix:** Wire in a future event-processing phase that calls `adjust_reputation_for_event`
based on event type + target faction membership.

## ISSUE-006: character.faction string field not migrated to MEMBER_OF edges
**Found:** 2026-05-06, during Phase 1.1 (faction nodes)
**Severity:** P3 (nice-to-fix)
**Where:** Existing Character nodes with a `faction` string property
**Description:** The migration script only adds the Faction node uniqueness constraint.
Pre-existing `character.faction` string fields are not converted to MEMBER_OF edges,
since that mapping is game-data-specific.
**Why deferred:** Needs operator-supplied mapping of faction name strings to Faction node IDs.
**To fix:** Provide a game-specific migration that reads character.faction, resolves it to
a Faction node ID, and creates the MEMBER_OF edge.

## Closed

## [FIXED] ISSUE-010: `seed.py` seeds via direct Neo4j, not the external API
**Found:** 2026-05-11, during API-based seeding task
**Severity:** P2 (misses client-parity)
**Where:** `src/npc_engine/data/seed.py` (deleted)
**Description:** `make seed` connected directly to Neo4j via Bolt, bypassing the API
entirely. Breaks if Neo4j port is restricted and doesn't exercise the public API surface.
**To fix:** New `src/npc_engine/data/api_seeder.py` seeds via HTTP API. Old `seed.py` and
`seed_queries.py` deleted. Makefile `seed:` target replaced by `seed-api:`.
**Fixed:** 2026-05-11, api-based-seeding task

## [FIXED] ISSUE-009: `scenario_reputation_drift.py` calls non-existent `POST /v1/admin/characters/`
**Found:** 2026-05-11, during API-based seeding task
**Severity:** P2 (blocking scenario)
**Where:** `e2e/scenarios/scenario_reputation_drift.py`
**Description:** Character creation called `POST /v1/admin/characters/` which does not exist.
Characters must be created via `POST /v1/graph/nodes/Character` with `{"properties": {...}}`.
**Fixed:** 2026-05-11, api-based-seeding task

## [FIXED] ISSUE-008: `conftest.py` default API key does not match dev `.env`
**Found:** 2026-05-11, during API-based seeding task
**Severity:** P2 (blocking e2e)
**Where:** `e2e/scenarios/conftest.py:42`
**Description:** Default `NPC_API_KEY` was `eval-key-change-me`; dev key is
`local_dev_secret_change_this_2026`. Scenarios failed with 401 without explicit env export.
**Fixed:** 2026-05-11, api-based-seeding task

## [FIXED] ISSUE-007: `conftest.py` uses `X-API-Key` header instead of `Authorization: Bearer`
**Found:** 2026-05-11, during API-based seeding task
**Severity:** P2 (blocking e2e)
**Where:** `e2e/scenarios/conftest.py:48`
**Description:** httpx default header was `X-API-Key: {key}`. The middleware only accepts
`Authorization: Bearer <token>` — all scenario requests returned 401.
**Fixed:** 2026-05-11, api-based-seeding task — changed to `Authorization: Bearer {api_key}`.

## [FIXED] ISSUE-001: top_p and stop_sequences stored but not forwarded to adapters
**Found:** 2026-05-05, during Phase 0.4 (per-engine LLM config)
**Severity:** P3 (nice-to-fix)
**Where:** `src/npc_engine/engines/llm/factory.py`, all adapter `generate`/`stream` call sites
**Description:** `EngineModelConfig.llm` declares `top_p` and `stop_sequences` fields
(required by ROADMAP 0.4 schema), but none of the LLM adapters accept these parameters.
The values are stored in config but silently ignored when building generation calls.
**Why deferred:** Adapters need interface updates (protocol + all implementations). Not
blocking — default adapter behaviour is acceptable for current backends.
**To fix:** Add `top_p: float` and `stop_sequences: list[str]` to `LLMClientProtocol.generate`
and `stream` signatures; update all adapters; forward from `DialogueLLMClient`.
**Fixed:** 2026-05-06, stability_refactor — added optional `top_p`/`stop_sequences` to all
three protocol methods; updated OllamaAdapter (forwarded to `options`), MistralAdapter
(forwarded to payload), MockLLMAdapter (accepted, ignored); `DialogueLLMClient` stores and
forwards both params; `DialogueHandler` passes them from `engine_model_config.llm`.

## [FIXED] ISSUE-002: currency_engine contract name vs economy/ directory mismatch
**Found:** 2026-05-05, during Phase 0.4 (per-engine LLM config)
**Severity:** P3 (nice-to-fix)
**Where:** `src/npc_engine/engines/contracts/currency_engine.yaml`,
`src/npc_engine/engines/economy/`
**Description:** `_engine_dir_from_contract_name("currency_engine")` → `"currency"`,
but the actual engine directory is `engines/economy/`. If `currency_engine` ever
gains `uses_llm: true`, `get_config("currency")` will look in the wrong directory.
Currently `uses_llm: false` so there is no runtime failure.
**Why deferred:** Not blocking today. Renaming the directory requires touching imports.
**To fix:** Either rename the contract to `economy_engine` or rename the directory to
`engines/currency/` and update all imports. Coordinate with any planned economy feature work.
**Fixed:** 2026-05-06, stability_refactor — renamed `engines/economy/` → `engines/currency/`;
updated `__init__.py` docstring. No import changes needed (directory was empty stub).

## [FIXED] ISSUE-003: OLLAMA_MODEL in Settings is superseded by per-engine model declaration
**Found:** 2026-05-05, during Phase 0.4 (per-engine LLM config)
**Severity:** P3 (nice-to-fix)
**Where:** `src/npc_engine/config.py` (`OLLAMA_MODEL` field),
`src/npc_engine/engines/llm/factory.py` (`create_llm_client`)
**Description:** `Settings.OLLAMA_MODEL` was the global model name used by the Ollama
adapter. The new `create_llm_client_for_engine` reads the model from `engine_config.llm.model`
instead, making `OLLAMA_MODEL` redundant for all engines that use the new factory path.
`OLLAMA_MODEL` is still read by the legacy `create_llm_client` function which remains for
backward compat.
**Why deferred:** Removing it requires auditing all remaining callers of `create_llm_client`
and may affect tests that construct Settings with this field.
**To fix:** After all call sites migrate to `create_llm_client_for_engine`, remove
`OLLAMA_MODEL` from `config.py` and delete the legacy `create_llm_client` function.
**Fixed:** 2026-05-06, stability_refactor — confirmed zero callers of `create_llm_client`;
removed `create_llm_client`, `BACKEND_BUILDERS`, and all private `_create_*` helpers from
`factory.py`; removed `OLLAMA_MODEL` and `LLM_BACKEND` from `config.py`; rewrote
`test_llm_factory.py` to target `create_llm_client_for_engine`.
